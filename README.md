# Another file manager
This is yet another file manager being made with Lua Player Plus. As of this writing, it is currently not suitable for normal use. It probably needs a rewrite at this point; however, since it's having to deal with multiple formats and lpp-3ds is still being worked on for ninjhax 2.5, it has been postponed.
